# Lovense

## Background

[Lovense](https://www.lovense.com/) has been manufacturing wireless Bluetooth
sex toys since 2011. Many of their models lines have undergone multiple hardware
and firmware revisions in that time. The protocol changes are usually minor, but
for clarity: unless otherwise indicated, this document refers to the latest
hardware and firmware revisions for each model line.

## Bluetooth Layer

Lovense toys use a serial-style RPC protocol over Bluetooth, with command
messages sent from the client and response messages sent from the toy. Messages
are terminated by `;` semicolons. Valid commands will always receive at least
one response, unless that command itself shuts down the toy first.

Depending on the model and firmware versions, valid commands that do not have
meaningful return value will respond with either the string `OK` or the original
command string, while invalid commands will respond with either the string `ERR`
or the original command string prefixed with `UNKNOWN,`.

Here is an example session, with whitespace added to distinguish transmitter and
receiver.

```
DeviceType;

  P:11:0082059AD3BD;

GetBatch;

  190124;

Battery;

  95;

GetPatten;

  P:01234;

GetPatten:4;

  P4:1/5:000042003720;
  P4:2/5:000002436658;
  P4:3/5:997339993001;
  P4:4/5:291111115111;
  P4:5/5:1110000000;

PowerOff;
```

These messages are exchanged over a Bluetooth LE Service exposing a single GATT
Characteristic. Messages are sent by assigning them as the value of the
Characteristic, and messages are received as value change notifications on the
Characteristic. Some of the earliest Lovense toys also supported exchanging
these messages over a Bluetooth SPP duplex stream for backwards-compatibility,
but this has been dropped.

The specific names and UUIDs used to identify Lovense Bluetooth LE services and
characteristics can vary across models and firmware versions, but they seem to
conform to the following rules:

- Device names must consist of the following:
  - the prefix `LVS-`, followed by
  - a name or [identifier](#model-identifiers) indicating a Lovense model line,
    followed by
  - a two digit suffix indicating the firmware version
- Service UUIDs must match one of the following:
  - `0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (first generation), or
  - `6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` (second generation), or
  - `XY300001-002Z-4bd4-bbd5-a6920e4c5653` (later models), where
    - `X` is the digit `4` or `5`
    - `Y` is any digit (`0` to `F`)
    - `Z` is the digit `3` or `4`
- Characteristic UUIDs may have any value.

If you are using a Bluetooth API such as WebBluetooth which requires all service
UUIDs to be declared upfront, you may need to generate the full list of possible
permutation of these rules. The service will only declare a single
characteristic, which your Bluetooth API should let you access without knowing
the UUID ahead of time. Once connected, you may want to start by using the
[`DeviceType`] command to confirm that the toy you've connected to is the one
you expect.

## Model Identifiers

Each Lovense model line has a corresponding one-letter identifier, which is used
to identify the model in the toy's Bluetooth name and `DeviceType` response.

| Model   | Identifier | Notes                    |
| :------ | :--------: | :----------------------- |
| Ambi    |    `L`     |                          |

| Edge    |    `P`     |                          |

| Max     |    `B`     |                          |
| Mission |     ❔      | no longer in production  |
| Nora    |    `A`     | newer Nora toys use `A`  |

#### Count Programmed Patterns

List the indexes of the patterns that are currently programmed into the toy. The
maximum number of patterns in 10, so each index will always be a single digit.

_Availability:_ Lush 2, Domi

_Command Format_

```
GetPatten;
```

_Return Example_

```
P:01234;
```

This return tells us that there are currently five patterns programmed on the
toy, with indices 0 through 4.

#### View Programmed Pattern

Returns a pattern that is currently programmed into the toy.

Each pattern is represented as a series of digits from 0 to 9, each indicating
the vibration level for one half-second of the pattern. (This is different than
the 0-20 scale used by the Vibrate command.)

The response is split into multiple messages, each containing up to 12 digits (6
seconds). Each response has a prefix indicating the pattern index, the number of
parts in the response, and the index of the response.

For the Domi, the pattern length must be between 5 and 50 seconds, so the
response will use a maximum of 9 messages, so the part count and indices will
always be a single digit.

For the Lush 2, the part count and indices are padded to always use two digits.

_Availability:_ Lush 2, Domi, Dolce

_Command Format_

```
GetPatten:4;
```

Domi response using one-digit part indices:

_Return Example_

```
P4:1/5:000042003720;
P4:2/5:000002436658;
P4:3/5:997339993001;
P4:4/5:291111115111;
P4:5/5:1110000000;
```

Lush 2 response using two-digit part indices:

_Return Example_

```
P4:01/01:346797643;
```

#### Run Programmed Patern

Starts running a programmed pattern on a loop. Takes an positive integer pattern
index to start running it, or 0 to stop running the pattern.

While Domi is able to take any pattern index, from 0 to 10, Lush 2 and Dolce
only seem to be able to take indices from 0 to 4. Other toys have not been
tested.
